# Importing a custom database

If you have an existing database (SQL backup `*.sql`) that you want to use, thereby overriding the installation default, replace the existing `opensim.sql` file in this directory with your [mysqldump](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html) output.  Please note the configured [OpenSim release version](http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Upgrading) since older databases may introduce backwards compatibility issues.
